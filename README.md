<b>Program: Project 3: Radix Sort  to Sort Strings (C++)</b>
Name: Vagner Machado
Due Date:  Soft copy: 2/18/2019 Monday before midnight
	     1 day late: -1 pt 2/19/2019 Tuesday before midnight
	     After 2/19/2019 -12 pts for all students who did not submit soft copy on time.
Due Date: Hard copy: 2/19/2019 Tuesday in class, -1 pt for late hard copy submission. 
Project 3
Algorithm in the main.cpp
 Step 0: inFile <- open the input file 
	outFile1 <- open outFile1  // for debugging
outFile2 <- open outFile2  // for the output of sorted data

Step 1: firstReading (inFile) // see algorithm below
Step 2:  close inFile 
Step 3: inFile <- open the input file // open the file second time
step 4: loadStack (inFile, Top) // see algorithm below

Step 5: printStack (outFile2) // Print caption!!!

Step 6: RadixSort (Top) // see algorithm below

step 7: closed all files
